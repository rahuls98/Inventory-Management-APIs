# Inventory-Management-APIs
A collection of API's for inventory, supply chain, resource and order management using Typescript. These API's use fundamental computer science algorithms to implement the functionalities. A React application will provide an interface to interact with the same.

Some sample algorithms:
- A Bankers Algorithm based order management algorithm
- Available to Promise algorithm
- A knapsack based maximization algorithm for stock utilization
- Cost of delay calculation algorithm
- A graph based algorithm for end-to-end monitoring of supply chain parameters
